<h3><br>2)Cost of Solar Panels</h3>
<div class="image3"></div>
<h5>
<b>The cost of solar panels is about $15,000 - $25,000 depending on the size of your solar
system. For a 7.5 kW system, the cost would be about $21,000. The cost of your solar panels
(including other hardware and installation) is based on an average cost per watt of $2.80.
Naturally, the cost is one of the major factors that homeowners consider when they think of
going solar. One of the great things about solar energy is that the fuel cost is essentially zero.
Nada. Zip. However, you still have to pay for the solar panels and other hardware, along with
the cost of installing them on your property. Here is a complete guide to financing your solar
power system.</b>

Bijli Bachao is an initiative that aims to help residential customers to reduce their electricity
consumption thereby reducing the monthly outflow of money towards electricity bill. The
benefits of the initiatives are many folds:</p>
<p2> 1) People save money on their electricity bills.</p2></br>
<p3> 2) Reduced energy consumption reduces our increasing dependence on a depleting resource: coal.</p3></br>
<p4> 3) Reduced energy consumption from urban areas can help reducing energy poverty in
the rural areas.</p4></br>
4) By burning less coal, we will reduce CO2 emissions, thereby protecting the environment..
