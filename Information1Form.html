<h3><br>3) Energy/Electricity and its units</h3>
<div class="image1"></div>
<div class="about"><h2>
A unit (as mentioned on the electricity bills) is represented in kWH or Kilowatt Hour. This is
the actual electricity or energy used. If you use 1000 Watts or 1 Kilowatt of power for 1 hour
then you consume 1 unit or 1 Kilowatt-Hour (kWH) of electricity. So the reading on the
electricity meter represents the actual electricity used. Just like the odometer on your vehicle
that shows the actual distance travelled by the vehicle, electricity meter shows the amount of
electricity that is used. So a 100-Watt bulb if kept on for 10 hours will consume:
100 x 10 = 1000 Watt-Hour = 1 Kilowatt-Hour (kWH) = 1 units (on your meter).</h2>
<h3><br>4) What are Power and Energy/Electricity</h3>
<div class="image2"></div>
<h4>
Power and Energy/Electricity are two words that are used so much for each other that many
feel that they mean the same. Interestingly both of them have a very different meaning. Power is the rate at which electricity is used and energy/electricity is the actual consumption.
To give an analogy, power is similar to speed but electricity/energy is the actual distance
traveled.</h4>
<h5 So Power x Time = Electricity (or energy)</h5>
<h3><br>5) Power and its units</h3>
<div class="image3"></div>
<h4>
Power is always represented in watt (W) or kilowatt (kW). A thousand (1000) watts make
one kilowatt. So if any appliance is rated as 1.2 kW then it means that it consumes electricity
at a rate of 1200 W. Now as we discussed earlier that power is the rate at which electricity is
consumed and not the actual electricity consumed, Watt or Kilowatt just represent the rate at
which electricity is consumed per hour. Which means that when you buy a 100 W bulb, it
does not consume 100 units of electricity but consumes at a rate of 100 W.</h4>
