<h3><br>9) Reducing Electricity Use and Costs</h3>
<div class="image1"></div>
<div class="about"><h2>
Reducing energy use in your home saves you money, increases our energy security, and
reduces the pollution that is emitted from non-renewable sources of energy. If you are
planning to install a small renewable energy system to make your own electricity, such as a
solar electric system or small wind turbine, reducing your electricity loads is the first stepâ€”
saving you money by allowing you to purchase a smaller system.</h2>
<h3><br>10) Electric Meters</h3>
<div class="image2"></div>
<h4>
The basic unit of measure of electric power is the Watt. One thousand Watts are called a kilowatt. When you use electricity to power a 1000-watt vacuum for 1 hour, you use 1,000
watt-hours (1,000 Wh) of electricity. One thousand watt-hours equals 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh).
Your utility bill usually shows what you are charged for the kilowatt-hours you use.
</h4>
<h5>
Electric meters use either digital displays or dials. The difference between one month's
reading and the next is the amount of energy units that have been used for that billing period.
You may wish to contact your local utility company for instructions on how to read your
electric meter.</h5>
