<h3><br>6) Estimating units consumed by any appliance</h3>
<div class="image1"></div>
<div class="about"><h2>
Now with most of the concepts explained we would like to make it easy for you to calculate
how much units does any appliance consume. Most appliances have wattage written on them
(either on their container box or somewhere on the appliance). Once you have the wattage,
next you need to figure out how many hours a day do you use it. After that you can use the
formula below:
Daily Units = (Wattage x Usage hours per day) ÷ 1000
Monthly Units = Units x 30 (or 28,29,31 based on month) </h2>
<h3><br>7) The Power to Save</h3>
<div class="image2"></div>
<h4>
    Once you know which devices consume the most energy, you can find ways to reduce
consumption. The biggest saving is often simply removing a device that you no longer really
need.
The easiest savings may come from turning off devices that you are not really using,
especially items like a media server or a light that operates all day. Computing equipment,
such as printers, can be turned off. Power strips and timers (or home automation controllers)
can power down items that are not in use. But be careful. Using a power strip to power down
is just like unplugging the devices; some devices can fail or lose data if powered down often
without using their power switch.
In many cases, replacing older equipment can save you money. Consider all the electronic
devices around you, and take a close look at the biggest power users. Then use the energy
calculator to determine what a more energy-efficient replacement would save.</h4>
<h3><br>8) Calculating Energy Costs</h3>
<div class="image3"></div>
<h4>
As every engineer knows, energy calculation is straightforward. The unit of electrical energy
is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), found by multiplying the power use (in kilowatts, kW) by the
number of hours during which the power is consumed. Multiply that value by the cost per
kWh, and you have the total energy cost.
Total energy cost = (Power in watts/1000) × hours operating × cost per kWh</h4>
